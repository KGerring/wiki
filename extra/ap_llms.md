## Problem
Going from **writing Python code to publishing and maintaining a package** is **time-consuming**.
First-time maintainers must learn multiple tools and concepts, e.g. [MyST], [SemVer], CI/CD ([pre-commit] hooks, GitHub workflows), and they often spend hours just to deploy a documentation site whereas well-resourced projects like [PyTorch] and [Scikit-Learn] have **dedicated websites** that serve as their project hubs.

## Solution
`afterpython` **automates** the tedious parts of Python package maintenance and generates a **project website** for **building community** and **hosting content** such as documentation, **blog posts**, tutorials, examples and more — empowering more developers to write packages with ease.

---
`afterpython` is a CLI tool that **abstracts away the complexity** of **content writing, website deployment, and package release/maintenance** by providing an opinionated set of modern tools — so you don’t have to spend time selecting or learning anything beyond the basics.

## Core Features
- [x] Write content directly in [MyST Markdown] or [Jupyter Notebook]
- [x] Go from writing to **website deployment in minutes** — no need to learn any of the underlying tools
- [x] Centralize all your content in a modern, **unified project website** — from documentation to blog posts
- [x] Zero-config orchestration — Pre-configured modern tooling with sane defaults (see [Tech Stack](#tech-stack)), so you can start maintaining packages immediately **without learning each tool**
- [x] **⚡ Full-text search** across **ALL** your content in your website — docs, blogs, tutorials, everything
- [ ] Export content as PDF — for example, combine all blog posts into a single PDF file
- [ ] **🤖 Embedded AI Chatbot** that answers questions directly using an in-browser LLM — at no cost

## Project Website
> The project website for `afterpython` is created using `afterpython` itself. See the [**website**](https://afterpython.afterpython.org).

You can create your own website too and deploy it to GitHub Pages in **less than a minute**! See [Quickstart](https://afterpython.afterpython.org/doc/quickstart).
